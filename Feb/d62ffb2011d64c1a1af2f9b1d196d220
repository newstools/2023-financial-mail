“Tourism’s unwelcome side effect” (Fox, February 16-22) refers. While I can sympathise with the idea of tourists having  an effect on the environment — both while travelling here and  being here — it does seem  a bit far-fetched to suggest that removing them (and the money they bring into the country) will solve our environmental problems. When Cape Town  mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis says in the Daily Maverick that we’re likely to have 2.5-million people living in the city as a result of urbanisation and migration by 2025, and 10-million “within a generation”, it does rather put the removal of a few tourists into perspective —  especially as they’ll help  feed a portion of the “economic refugees” through taxes and jobs. Maybe there’s a bit of a “dog in the manger” attitude here? Surely the problem in the Cape is that it’s a victim of its own success? Making it the same as the rest of the country will chase away  the tourists and the internationally mobile Saffers, and even the economic migrants.
