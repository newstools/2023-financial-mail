A recent visit to where I used to farm gave me a synopsis of the  state of the nation. After passing Hofmeyr, I noticed that my phone had no service. Thinking it was just courtesy  of Eskom, I didn’t give it a second thought. But on  arrival in Molteno, my son informed me there has been no cell service for the past month; the only comms he has is via Wi-Fi from a private service provider. How the town does any outside business is anybody’s guess. There are times when Wi-Fi  is just not enough. And what of people without access to Wi-Fi? No-one seems to know the cause: some say cables were stolen; others say the batteries can’t charge between bouts of load-shedding. Telkom used to operate when the power was off, but it’s no longer functional for all here. This is a direct reflection of  our deteriorating state. The  population has  almost  become used to the erratic load-shedding schedules, but when communication breaks down it  really is an important marker on our slippery slope.
