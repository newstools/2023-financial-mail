Question: Loads of people now work from home, but the South African Revenue Service (Sars) is  refusing to allow them to deduct interest on their mortgage from their tax returns as part of their home office  allowance — how is that possibly fair? This comes after rates have gone up. — Joanne Baynham Answer: Sars took a  tough stance against claiming for working from home  in 2021, so much so that 71% of claims submitted were disallowed. Furthermore, in an interpretation note issued on  March 4 2022, it said  interest is not deductible. The general approach of Sars  is that  people working from home are very limited in  what  they can claim, even more so if they own the property. Every tax return with a home office claim goes for  audit, which also prolongs the time  for refunds to be paid. Remember: Sars is a tax collector, and tax collectors are seldom “fair”. There are, however a few work-from-home hacks you could adopt: In a nutshell: Sars makes it very hard to claim anything whatsoever for  working from home. Strongly consider whether the potential tax reward is  worth the stress, time and effort that’s needed. — André Bothma, www.taxmaverick.co.za We want to hear from you.
