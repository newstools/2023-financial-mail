1. Prowler spotted on top wine farm The Overberg  to the east of Cape Town  teems with wildlife, as the FM reported last year. It’s no Kruger Park, however, because many animals are in inaccessible parts and are mostly seen when  captured on static cameras. The most recent sighting is that of a leopard on the Paul Cluver  wine estate in Elgin. Observers said the sighting was not unusual. 2. Making stories less Grimm The censoring of  Roald Dahl  has been widely criticised. But toning down grotesque characters  has long been a practice in children’s literature. Victorians eliminated blood and gore from the Grimm brothers’  fairy tales, adding frocks and happy endings. An illustration of a pie in a 1902 edition of  The Tale of Peter Rabbit was removed because Peter’s father was in the pie. 3.  Ferrari’s fake roar For supercar enthusiasts there is no sound more satisfying than the roar of a Ferrari engine as the driver pumps the accelerator. Now, as the Italian manufacturer goes green, engineers have found a way for the quieter electric model to have the  distinctive growl too:  pipe the sound through speakers.
