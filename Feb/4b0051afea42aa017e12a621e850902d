Over the past three  weeks, my area,  which includes  George,   has  had power during our load-shedding slots.  It must be  annoying for business owners who have scheduled off-time for their staff around load-shedding, only to  find suddenly that they have no staff when the power is on. It raises  the question: is this load-shedding thing necessary if areas can be left with their electricity on when they should be off? It doesn’t seem to affect the power situation. The same question applies to the state of the nation and budget  speeches. If load-shedding is so important, why are those events  not scheduled around the blackouts? So many unanswered questions. Are we being manipulated? Peter Gordon GrantSedgefield The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
