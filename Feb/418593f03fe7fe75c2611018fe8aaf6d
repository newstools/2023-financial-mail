A good week for Nomcebo Zikode Nomcebo Zikode used to be a backing singer until Emazulwini was a hit for her in 2018, followed soon after with an even bigger one when she co-wrote and featured in Jerusalema. On Sunday came another accolade, this time on the world stage at the Grammys in Los Angeles. Together with fellow South Africans Zakes Bantwini and Wouter Kellerman, she won in the best global music performance category for their song Bayethe. They pipped Nigerian singer Burna Boy’s Last Last for the award. A bad week for Themba Khumalo So Themba Khumalo and his dissembling sidekick at South African Tourism, Johan van der Walt, believe that R900m spent over three years on a sliver of a Tottenham Hotspur sleeve will generate R88bn in foreign tourist spending. That is wishful thinking on the scale of backing Spurs to win the league three years in a row. The gambling pair who want to bet one-third of South African Tourism’s budget on a single number need a better argument than the cliché-loaded, meaningless jargon Khumalo spouted in their defence.
