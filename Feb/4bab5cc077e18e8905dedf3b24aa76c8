Petty party politics is destroying orderly government and the  management of local authorities  in South Africa. Democracy is supposed to enable citizen participation in decision-making in public affairs. There is, however, a flipside to  democratic rights: responsibility. What we are experiencing is a reckless, power-hungry grab by  greedy and irresponsible petty party politicians. Their  main interests are  status — wearing a mayoral chain, for example, or securing the position of chair on a senior  committee — and financial  benefits. The recent flip-flopping  by some minority parties (with the collusion of bigger parties) around  no-confidence votes is making a circus of what should be a local government institution of responsible commitment  to serve  the public by responsible community leaders. The motto of these gamblers appears to be: “I’ll scratch your back while you scratch mine  — until I can grip my dagger if you do not agree to my demands.” If this pattern is  copied at national and provincial government level after the 2024 elections, there will be serious problems.
