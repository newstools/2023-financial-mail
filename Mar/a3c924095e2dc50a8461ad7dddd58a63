It is  alarming to note that after such a long time of good work and commitment in providing  scientific and professional oversight of our matric results, Umalusi has been subjected  to a flurry of negative criticism, which doesn’t add value at all. Umalusi (the Zulu word meaning  guardian or shepherd)  has been guarding and maintaining the credibility, authenticity and integrity of our matric results since its establishment. It has worked tirelessly to ensure  results that are fair and unbiased.  We have to  appreciate the body  for its oversight of our matric results, which were once  biased and segregatory. Criticism is valuable only when it provides solutions to identified problems. Good work, Umalusi — just keep making us proud.
