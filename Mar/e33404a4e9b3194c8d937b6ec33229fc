1. Easily sidestepped Protests in South Africa can be multi-day affairs that involve killing people, blockading the N3 and pillaging malls and warehouses. Then there’s the low-key kind, like the one staged on Saturday  at Cape Town Stadium ahead of a Stormers vs Sharks rugby match. At issue was the South African Rugby Union’s decision in 2021 to place the deeply indebted Western Province under its administration,  which put the noses of some former provincial officials out of joint.  Only 45 protesters  turned up,  barely enough to form a modest maul. 2.

Howard Schultz, the company’s founder, called the Oleato a “transformational idea” — his own — that had come to him while he was travelling through Italy last year.
