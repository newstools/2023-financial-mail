Many are saying that former Eskom CEO André de Ruyter pulled the trigger too early. He certainly did not — he has  been a corporate man for long enough to know the consequences of talking outside of committees or revealing confidential reports. If De Ruyter  had done this after leaving the utility, his revelations  would have been laughed off as sour grapes. But what  got the world’s attention was that he then left the utility “with immediate effect” [after a damning interview with eNCA’s Annika Larsen]. De Ruyter  in a one-hour interview has done more for South Africa than  all the committees and the Zondo commission put together. Should anything untoward happen to him or  his family, the world will know who gave the order. Give this man a  Bell’s. Peter Gordon GrantSedgefield The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
