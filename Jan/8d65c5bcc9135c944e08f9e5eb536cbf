What is a “party hack”? Is it someone who puts party before country? Similarly, is cadre  deployment a policy of putting party before country? By all reasonable accounts, it is. Last week  Kevin McCarthy was elected speaker of the House of Representatives  in the US. After being elected, he said: “As speaker of the House my ultimate responsibility is not to my party. Our responsibility is to our country.” That, I believe, is the correct attitude for a senior public official whose salary is  paid by the taxpayer. In attending to  municipal chaos in Mangaung, newly elected ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said strict steps would be taken against ANC councillors who co-operate with the opposition. Surely that qualifies as a “party hack” statement? Equally, the repeated commitment by President Cyril Ramaphosa to cadre deployment? South Africa’s  problems of corruption and inefficiency are  facilitated by a mindset of “party before country”. As that is the oft-repeated ANC approach, the public should realise that the time of ANC government is over. VA VolkerPietermaritzburg The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
