Bright Khumalo, portfolio manager: Vestact Buy: LVMH We like the  luxury goods sector, with the Covid policy relaxation  in China being a tailwind.  Chinese citizens  can fly abroad again —  they’ll go  on holiday and patronise  high-end stores  in Milan,   Paris or New York to shop for such  totems as handbags and  jewellery. The big dog in the sector  is LVMH. It’s diversified, it has 80-odd different brands across wines, spirits, watches and jewellery. Earnings in  Southeast Asia should bounce  back and  may even hit new highs. Many people were worried about succession at LVMH, but CEO Bernard  Arnault is  charting a very clear path for this within the group  and at  strategic brands such as  Christian Dior, Fendi and Louis Vuitton. Sell:  Virgin Galactic and Beyond Meat I would avoid all of the meme stocks such as  Virgin Galactic or Beyond Meat. Virgin Orbit’s  recent effort to place satellites in orbit failed and it is  still trying to prove the model. If you can’t get the basics right, it’s a big problem. I’m not saying it’s the end but it’s not looking good  in terms of capital raises. And the idea of helicopter money is behind us, so investors will be reluctant to take a  punt because you’re looking at a Fed funds rate of above 5% this year. It doesn’t make sense to try to find the next thing that’s going to pop. Avoid.
