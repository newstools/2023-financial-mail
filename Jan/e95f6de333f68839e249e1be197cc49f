1. Waste not, want not Researchers in the US and Germany conducting separate studies of  human waste say the world is confused — it’s actually not waste at all.  Scientists at  the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart and the Leibniz Institute of Vegetable  & Ornamental Crops say levels of harmful microbes or drug residues in  human faeces and urine are so low that it’s perfectly safe to save money and use them as nutrient-rich crop fertiliser. At West Virginia University, an engineering professor is developing technology for home recycling of urine. 2.
