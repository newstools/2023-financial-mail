So Carl Niehaus is planning to establish a political party?  The man’s always been good for a giggle — and fodder for cartoonists — but this time he must have attracted  hysterical laughter from a gobsmacked public. On what is Niehaus  basing his reasons for such a giant and hellishly expensive step? What is his claim to fame, other than  having established himself as a picketing joker? And who does he imagine would  want to join a party with little or no credentials? Those who would  are undoubtedly of the same ilk. That the ANC needs to be  taken on is a given. But Carl and his motley crew are not the ones to do it. He should join Julius Malema — at least they share similarly skewed thinking.
