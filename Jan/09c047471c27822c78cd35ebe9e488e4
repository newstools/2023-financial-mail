If only President Cyril Ramaphosa would  fulfil his promise of taking immigration  policy under intense scrutiny, he’d be doing the nation a great service. South Africa  just doesn’t have enough jobs and homes to cater for the demand. The recent census, if done properly, would show the percentage of  immigrants crossing our borders illegally. Many of them, rightly or wrongly, find good jobs here. It’s a breeding ground for xenophobia. Once a clear-cut policy is introduced — one  based on reality —  properly trained border post staff will  be better equipped to address  the problem. Of course, this  presupposes that borders are safeguarded with top-notch policing. And proper fencing. Cliff BuchlerClaremont The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
