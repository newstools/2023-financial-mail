Mark du Toit, co-founder:  OysterCatcher Investments BUY: Quilter The opportunity for Quilter has been created because there’s a new worry about the UK’s macroeconomic situation. Yes, the cost of living has increased quickly but we do see inflation being brought back under control and  the  long-term savings market hasn’t  materially changed. Quilter’s share price has been caught up in this whole  sell-off and on our  bottom-up valuation process this looks like a good entry point. Quilter is the second-largest advisory business in the UK, so there’s  still room for  it to grow market share;   it has enough scale so  it’s not under threat.  It’s going to have tailwinds from global markets now as we reach the end of the rate hiking cycle, and as  assets grow  it earns higher fees. It also pays a nice dividend — the  full-year dividend yield is 5.3% and it’s trading on a p:e of 10. We believe that should be 16. SELL: Bidvest It’s a great company — a big industrial business in South Africa. Its earnings are still dominated by the South African businesses. Currently  it’s growing offshore earnings but  the acquisitions  it’s making  have lower returns than  its current business, so earnings will be diluted by M&A activity. The group is growing earnings at 7% a year and  it trades on a forward dividend yield of 6.3% but we think the business  will be constrained by the local economy. Given that the overseas acquisitions are going to be expensive we don’t see them generating  good long-term returns.
