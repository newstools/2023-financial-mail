Load-shedding was a term virtually unheard of in  pre-democracy  South Africa, and Eskom was an entity that was seldom in the public eye. All of this has changed in recent times, and we are now faced with a national power crisis. The effects of load-shedding have been damaging in various degrees to most people and businesses, and  much has been written on this subject and the related underperformance of Eskom. This underperformance is attributable to many factors, including the employment of a double-digit number of CEOs and allegations of widespread corruption, incompetence and misappropriation of assets. CEO André de Ruyter  has resigned and is unfortunately due to leave the entity shortly. Meanwhile, it’s reported that mineral resources & energy minister Gwede Mantashe claims the power crisis can be  fixed/tackled in six  to 12 months. If this is so, then surely the question that arises is  why the problem is only being actioned now? D WincklerPlettenberg Bay The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
